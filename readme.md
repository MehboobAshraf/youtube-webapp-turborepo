## About Project
---
**Disclaimer**:

*This is project is for education purpose only and was made to illustrate example of building microfrontend using Angular, Module Federation.*   

---

**There is 1 host (shell) and 3 remote apps (watch-app, likes-app, history-app). Each app is deployed to different hosting storage.**     

**There are 3 versions of source codes available:**   
[Turborepo (Current Repo)](https://github.com/vugar005/youtube-webapp-turborepo)   
[Nx](https://github.com/vugar005/youtube-webapp-nx)   
[Lerna](https://github.com/vugar005/youtube-webapp-lerna)  

---
**NOTE**:

*Server side rendering is implemented only on Lerna and Turborepo edition*

<a id="getting-started"></a>
## Getting Started üöÄ
### Prerequisites
Since workspaces are available from npm v7, you should have <b>NodeJs 16+</b> installed.

1- Install turbo globally:
```bash 
npm install turbo@1.2.8 -g
```  
2- On root project install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```  
3- Start project and navigate to localhost:4200:  
```bash
npm run serve
```
Other commands: please see ```package.json``` for other commands.

## Pros and cons of Nx, Turborepo and Lerna tools
Below are just my experiences working in those tools. They can be inaccurate.   
### Lerna
‚úÖ Supports both same and different versions of libraries (such as Angular, RxJs)   
‚úÖ Native - Use Angular CLI   
‚ùå Configuration of applications required a change to `angular.json` to make it work. Switched to `ngx-build-plus` builders to support custom webpack config.  
‚ùå Slow development efficiency. Rebuild everytime you make changes to common packages such as UI   
‚ùå No dependency graph   

### Nx
‚ùå Not supports both same and different versions of libraries (such as Angular, RxJs). Only Monorepo.   
‚ùå Not native. Uses Nx CLI  
‚ùå Configuration of applications required a change to `angular.json` to make it work. Switched to Nx Officially Supported Builders to support custom webpack config.   
  Problems with adding new packages (such as ssr)    
‚úÖ Very fast development efficiency   
‚úÖ Powerful dependency graph   

### Turborepo
‚ùå Not supports both same and different versions of libraries (such as Angular, RxJs). Only Monorepo.   
‚úÖ Native - Use Angular CLI  
‚ùå Configuration of applications required a change to `angular.json` to make it work. Switched to `ngx-build-plus` builders to support custom webpack config.   
‚úÖ Fast development efficiency   
‚úÖ Dependency graph

## Upgrade Guide
To upgrade angular applications. Example:

**On root:**

```
npx @angular/cli@13 update @angular/core@13 @angular/cli@13 --force
```

**On each remote app:**

``` 
ng update @angular/core --migrate-only=true --from=13 --to=14
ng update @angular/cli --migrate-only=true --from=13 --to=14
```

## What is next?
Currently, the unit tests were not aded since the project was focused on main features such as module federation, managing state, intercommucation and so on. It can be started soon.   

<a id="backlog"></a>
### Backlog 
1) Add I18n translations
2) Add secondary entry points for common-ui
